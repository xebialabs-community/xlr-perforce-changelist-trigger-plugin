# xlr-perforce-changelist-trigger-plugin

## Overview
- The plugin will repeatedly query a Perforce repository using the latest Java interface JAR file (p4java-2017.1.1508216-bundle.jar the time of development) for the latest changelist applied to the repo.  The polling interval is configurable.          
-  Whenever the plugin detects a change in value of the latest changelist id, it will trigger a release off a template in XL Release.  The changelist id is passed to the release as a variable.

## Change history

#### Perforce trigger
- Then define a release trigger that references the server. Note that the changelist id is available as a trigger variable. 
- You can filter the changes that trigger the release by a workspace. Map the depot paths you want to watch in a new workspace,
  then configure the release trigger to use that workspace.
